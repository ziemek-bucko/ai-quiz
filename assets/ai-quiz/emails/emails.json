The domain search feature has been incredibly helpful for our outreach campaigns.\n\nI'm writing because I'm a bit confused about the email verification process. When I try to verify some of the addresses we've found, I'm getting mixed results. Some show as \"deliverable\" while others are \"risky\" even though they're from the same domain.\n\nIs there a way to batch verify emails? And could you explain a bit more about what makes an email \"risky\" vs. \"deliverable\"?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nBest,\nMichael",

I've recently upgraded to the Hunter Pro plan and I'm trying to integrate the API with our CRM system.\n\nI noticed that there seems to be a limit on the number of API requests per day, but I couldn't find the exact number in the documentation. Our team needs to verify approximately 500 emails daily - would the Pro plan accommodate this volume?\n\nAlso, we occasionally experience spikes in our verification needs. Is there any flexibility in temporarily increasing limits for specific projects?\n\nI appreciate any guidance you can provide on this matter.\n\nThanks,\nSarah",

I sent out a campaign to about 50 prospects yesterday, but the dashboard is only showing opens for about half of them, which seems odd based on the responses I've received.\n\nI've double-checked my settings and everything looks correct. Is there a known issue with the tracking pixel? Or could it be related to recipients' privacy settings?\n\nThis is pretty urgent as I need to report on campaign performance by Friday. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks,\nJamie",

    "text": "Subject: Weird bounce rates in Smartlead campaign\n\nHi Malik,\n\nI'm seeing something strange with our latest Smartlead campaign and hoping you might have some insight. We launched a new sequence on Tuesday targeting CMOs in the healthcare industry - a list we've used before with good results.\n\nFor some reason, we're getting a 27% bounce rate, which is way higher than our usual 3-5%. I've spot-checked some of the bounced addresses and they seem valid. Even weirder, some addresses that delivered fine in our campaign last month are bouncing now.\n\nHave you seen anything like this before? Any troubleshooting tips would be super helpful. I'm worried there might be something wrong with our account or maybe an issue on Smartlead's end.\n\nThanks for your help!\nAlex",
